### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Joseph Udonsak,  I'm a software engineer. While I primarily work with PHP (Symfony), I also have experience working with Javascript (React and Next.JS) and Go. I started working with Go in 2019 and have had tonnes of fun working on technical content for the language - I look forward to working on more projects with it. 

I also enjoy writing - I'm currently a guest author for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/udonsakj). In my spare time, I write about interesting work challenges I've encountered on [Medium](https://ybjozee.medium.com/) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/ybjozee). 

While it has its dark days, I can't see myself doing anything else and I hope that one way or another, I can make your journey more enjoyable than mine.
