### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Joseph Udonsak,  I'm a software engineer. While I primarily work with PHP (Symfony), I also have experience working with Javascript (React and Next.JS). Of recent, I've been learning the Go programming language and looking forward to working on more projects with it. 

I also enjoy writing - I'm currently a guest author for Sanity and Twilio. In my spare time, I write about interesting work challenges I've encountered on Medium. 

While it has its dark days, I can't see myself doing anything else and I hope that one way or another, I can make your journey more enjoyable than mine.
